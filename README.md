NoBS Chemistry study guide

This study guide aims to cover CHEM 1413 in a concise and understandable manner. For now, our focus is on perfecting the material for the 
first semester (CHEM 1413) and only focus on the second semester later. While this material may come too late to assist students on the 
final, next semester's notes should (hopefully) track the lectures and recitations closely. Every attempt will be made to be 
comprehensive, but ultimate this study guide is not designed to replace attending the lecture or reviewing the notes and practice exams 
which Dr. Schwartz hands out. Please contact Jeffrey Wang for more instructions.
